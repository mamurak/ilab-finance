      ## Overdraft policy

      - To help you avoid fees, we won't authorize ATM withdrawals or everyday debit card purchases when you don't have enough money in your account at the time of the transaction.
      - When we determine you don't have enough money in your account to cover other items such as checks or scheduled payments, we'll either authorize and pay the item and overdraw your account (an overdraft item), 1 or decline or return the item unpaid (a returned item). When this happens, you may be charged a fee. See details below.
      - We offer two overdraft setting options for how you want us to process your other transactions.

      Option 2: Decline All - You can choose this setting if you would like to have your transactions declined or returned unpaid when you don't have enough money. With this setting you can avoid Overdraft Item Fees.

      - Checks or scheduled payments will be returned unpaid if you don't have enough money in your account.
      - If your account becomes overdrawn for any reason, we won't charge you an Overdraft Item Fee.
      - When we decline or return a transaction, we won't charge a fee, but the payee may.

      Keep in mind, regardless of your overdraft setting, if you set up Balance Connect ® for overdraft protection, 2 we'll automatically transfer available funds from one or more of your linked backup accounts if you're about to overdraw your account.

      Please see the Personal Schedule of Fees and Deposit Agreement and Disclosures for your account terms.

      - 1. Our overdraft fee of $10 may apply for overdrafts created by check, recurring debit card transactions, or other electronic means. If your account is overdrawn, you must immediately bring your account to a positive balance. We pay overdrafts at our discretion and we reserve the right not to pay. For example, we typically do not pay overdrafts if your account is not in good standing.
      - 2. Transfers from a linked (1) brokerage account enrolled in margin lending, (2) Loan Management Account ® , (3) credit card, or (4) line of credit and/or Home Equity Line of Credit are subject to interest charges and governed by the terms and conditions of the account.
